A json based resume webpage. Made to work with `jekyll` based `github-pages`. Same json sources can be used to render a pdf using `lualatex`.

> On Windows, with latest [MikTex 2.9](https://miktex.org/download), you can compile the pdf by running `lualatex main.tex` in the command line.

You can use the sources here with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/kumar-pallavs-one-page-resume/cqtggyfbyrdk) or ShareLatex. Make sure you use `lualatex` compiler.
